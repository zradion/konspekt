  <p>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde borned in Dublin, Ireland. Died in Paris, France.</p>
  <p>Was an Irish poet and playwright. The one of most popular playwrights in London
  in the early 1890s. And the most famos novel of him is "The pecture of Dorian Grey".</p>
  <p>
    Wilde's parents were anglo-irish intellectuals in Dublin. He received a very good education. He knew many languages, was an excellent speaker. Since childhood, he would have a skill - to read very fast. He got married in 1884 and had two children (Cyril and Vyvyan) by Constance Lloyd. But his passion were boys. He spent all his and not his money for them. The main person in his life was Lord Alfred Douglas (Bosie) - the rare bastard. Thanks to him Wilde got to prison for two years. Before that, he had contracted syphilis and after releasing he was absolutly ill man. His Bosie never help him despite he could. His words were - nobody needs you when you're not on a pedestal. And later wrote in his autobiography that Wilde was a genuine king of abominations who led England into pitch darkness. Apparently this was not far from the truth.
