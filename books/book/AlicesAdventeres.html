        <h3>events:</h3>
<p>*Alice run for White Rabbit and fall into the rabbit hole.<br>
*She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps handing from the roof. There is glass table in the middle of that with gold key on it. And many different doors all around and only little one to which this key fits. She has got experimented with '<i>drink me'</i> and '<i>eat me</i>' for change her height. And had wept the whole sea.<br>
*Then she played with some animals and that was very much like an election race with dumb politicians.<br>
*She in rabbit's home. As it turned out, Rabbit is a very important person and he has different servants. Alice is getting very big in the house and then small again.<br>
*Then she found herself in a thick wood which turned out to be a grass. An enormous puppy almost run over her. She escaped it and met a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top of mushroom, smoking a long hookah. 'Keep your temper' - was advice of Caterpillar and merely remarking as it went how to use mushroom (a very strong remedy). Alice have confrontation with pigeon when she was like a serpent. After that she got taken her real shape.<br>
*She came up to an open place with house about four feet high and had to shrink herself till nine inches; footman in livery that looks like a fish came running out of the wood and handle an other that looks like a frog a letter with invitation from Queen to play croquet; Alice came into house. It was a kitchen whith a lot of pepper in the air. Cook was making soup and than throwing everything within her reach; Large Chshire cat was grinning from ear to ear; Duchess was nursing a baby, sneezed occasionally and the baby was howling and snesing without a pause. She was very cruel with baby. Named him as a pig, song lullaby to him which was very rough. And in the end throwed baby to Alice. And Alice saw that it turned to a pig.<br>
*Than she is going to March Hare house. It's chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. Alice raised herself to about feet high. March Hare, Hatter and Dormouse was sitting at the table set out under a tree in front of the house. They quarrelled with the time and since that it's always six o'clock. Hatter has watch that shows just days and they make riddles, that have no answers.<br>
*Once more she found herself in the long hall. This time she managed to go into the garden through little door via gold key. She's changed herself till one foot high.<br>
*Alice enters the world of playing cards. Three gardeners painting roses in red.
The queen appears with her retinue: ten soldiers carring clubs, ten courtiers, ornamented all over with diamonds, after these came the royal children (also ten) ornamented with hearts, next guests, mostly Kings and Queens, then followed the Knave of Hearts and at last of all grand procession, came the King and Queen of Hearts. Alice gets an invitation to play croquet.<br>
*It was very strange play: croquet-ground  was all ridges and furrows, balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes and soldiers imaged the arches. Alice had talk to the Duchess, who was talking nonsense and called that 'morality'.<br>
*After all the players were arrested and sentenced Queen took Alice to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle to listen the story 'The Lobster Quadrille'. That was the Beautiful_Soup.<br>
*And the last event that Alice attended in her dream was the trial of the Knave - a complete pun.
