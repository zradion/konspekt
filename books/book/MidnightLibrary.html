        <h3>events:</h3>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Bedfordshire. Nineteen years before she decided to die (Nora Seed is 16 years old) - she is in school library plays chess with Mrs Elm. Nora think that Mrs Elm treat her as mother do - as a mistake in need of correction. But also Mrs. Elm is on the same wavelength as her; Her brother had left; She's stopped swimming; She finds out that her father has died.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Now. Bedfordshire. Bancroft Avenue 33A. Nora sat on her dilapidated sofa scrolling internet and felling lonely, when someone rang her doorbell. That was Ash. Few years ago he asked her out for a coffee and she had short conversations with him in the shop at work. Now he came to tell her that her ginger tabby cat Voltaire (Volt) is lying dead on the street. Probably hit by a car. Only sertraline stoped her crying. Ash helped her to bury cat. She couldn't sleep late and next day was late for work at String Theory. She was fired mainly because of she put off customers with her sad face. Nora wandered around Bedford, remembering all her losses. Deceased parents, her swimming she quit, her band with Joe and Ravi she wrote music for she left and let everyone down, she ruined life her boyfriend Dan pulling out wedding. Nora entered the newsagent's sheltering from the rain and encounter with Ravi, got a lot of negativity cause all of them mad at her. After that, she had an unpleasant conversation with the brusque saleswoman. She went out. She had no one to talk to. Her former best friend Izzy didn't reply on her message. She forgot about her music lesson and lost her only student. The old man neighbor said he wouldn't need her collect his pills any more. And she felt superfluous herself to the universe. She left a farewell letter and took all the pills for to die.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Nora emerged at the Midnight Library at 00:00:00 and time have stopped. It was solid, rectangular building about the size of a church. She could see pillars, stone facade, a large wooden central door, a grandeur roof, grand-looking clock on the front gable, tall dark arched windows. She went in. The place was well lit, and the floor was light stone. She had taken a few steps forward and could no longer see walls at all - just bookshelves. Aisles of shelves up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad corridor. She took one corridor and set off. She soon realized that she won't find a way out. The books were everywhere, all green with multifarious shades without titles or author names and the only  other variation was size: similar height but varied in width. Despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh. Here Nora saw the librarian, recognizing her as Mrs. Elm.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs.Elm told Nora that this was her library and every book here - is a version of her life. Than handed the book to Nora which wasn't like others. It was grey and heavy. That was Book of Regrets. Nora chose her main regret, then Mrs. Elm picked up a book with a new life for her. Nora began to read from the beginning and turned out in that life.</p>

<p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;In this life, Nora did not run away from the wedding with Dan. Their dreams have come true. They have pub in the Oxfordshire countryside - The Three Horseshoese. A couple years ago they bought it cheaply and in a neglected state and then renovated in with a mix of a modest inheritance (Dan's) and savings and bank loans. She had a good terms with Izzy, changed with her in messages. Nora noted a wedding photo where were Izzy, her brother Joe, Ravi with someone woman. Everybody looked happy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; Dan looks different. Wrinkles around his eyes, dark circles, older. He seems to drunk a lot. Nora remembers that something was annoying about him but nothing overtly wrong. He  had been so lovely to her mum and could talk at ease about anything, he was so full of dreams about future, he was attractive and easy to be around, and passionate about art and always stoped to chat with homeless. He cared about world. Nora felt different in her body too. A little healthie, a little stronge, but tense. She had short conversation with Dan in a bedroom. His voice sounded empty and cold to her. She finds out they trying for baby, there's something wrong with it. Memories came flooding back her, as she played him a song she had written for The Labyrinths 'Beautiful sky', she convinced the best she had ever written and dedicated it by her new life with him, but he had listened to it with a shruggish indifference and his over-the-top reaction when she'd once told him about customer who casually asking Nora if she wanted to go for a coffee some time and that was he who made her refuse from work in band. Nora can remember that Dan's humour hinged on other people especially on her, he had listened to a lot of annoying podcasts that he thought Nora should listen to, and laughed in a way that grated on her, and gargled louldy with mouthwash, he hogged the duvet and  could accasionally be arrogant in his opinions on art and film and music. And now she finds out that he had sex with someone and didn't seem to be seeking atonement. Nora told him everything she thought about him and about this life. She said he should be grateful to her for not giving up on the wedding that day, and how would he have suffered then and now he drink like a fish and use it as excuse for screwing someone else and she refused of her own dreams for his sake.  That was too much. She start wanted to quit the life. She went into bathroom, said Good Luck to her reflection in the mirrow and leave ... into the library. </p>

<p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, Nora chose a life in which she did not let her cat out and found him dead under the bed.</p>

<p>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Nora has flown to Australia with Izzy. A month later, Izzy was killed in a car accident. Nora works at the ferry terminal, sells tickets. She lives in a modest apartment with a roommate. Goes to the saltwater pool next to the ocean. In this life, Nora is unpretentious in clothes and hardly uses makeup. She is happy with the hot sun, bright landscapes and friendly people, but she cannot get rid of depression. She tried to commit suicide. She takes antidepressants, smokes marijuana, and is always late for work. She finds out all this as soon as she appears in this world and decides to leave this life. </p>

<p>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;This there is a life in which she has a success. She didn't give up swimming and feel yourself the fittest she ever felt. She had made it to the Olympics twice - had won a gold medal and a silver one. She had retired at twenty-eight. Her dad still alive with new wife Nadia and her mother died. Mom drank a lot when father left her. Her brother Joe is her manager (organizes her performances and takes 20%). He was gay, just like in that life, but he was happy here - he has been married to Ewan for five years already. It was successeful life where she didn't read the book, without music and real friends. In this life she suffered from depression as well and tried to commit suiside.</p>

<p>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;Svalbard (Шпицберген). Nora found herself in a boat with research scientists with headache and hangover after vodka. It was very cold. Nora was overwhelmed by the beauty of Arctic landscape. During their trip to the island, she had to drive away the polar bear alone. But this experience made her want to live and to love her parents as well. And also she met Hugo, who visited lives that wasn't his as she do. He called himself slider. There were videos in his library, and his uncle leaded him. Nora had sex with him and she was disaappoinment and felt like she might not have been there at all.</p>

<p>6.&#160;&#160;&#160;Fame. She is a rockstar with 'The Labyrinths'. She looks perfect, has 11.3 million followers. This life like one big racecourse and she has no idea if she is jockey or horse in it. Her former boyfriend - Ryan Baily - star of movie and her dreams. She has houses in LA and on the Amalfi Coast and she misses her home and her family very much. You can have everything and feel nothing (her post). She started realise that maybe there are no easy paths, there are just paths and lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;She remembered how once, when she was seventeen, she managed to swim across a river in the dark and cold water with the strong current, just to impress her brother and other guys. That was very difficult. It seemed that both banks of the river were constantly at an equal distance from each other. And that was how she felt most of her life - caught in the middle, struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. But no player should give up until at least one piece is on the board.</p>

<p>7.&#160;&#160;&#160;The next life that Nora chose was to work at an animal shelter. She woke up at a quarter to eight, drove to work in a old, tatty Hyundai (not too clean) and did animal care work. There was a man who worked there - Dylan. She saw him at school. He was two years younger than she was. She liked him. And in this life, he was her boyfriend.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;That day, for lunch, they ate what they had brought with them, had dinner at a restaurant and went to Dylan's house to watch a movie. His house was full of dogs, and there was a strong dog smell. Some slept with him. It all seemed very sweet to Nora, but still it wasn't her life.</p>

<p>8.&#160;&#160;&#160;Next life was like what she read on the bottle label of wine. Now she was Nora Martinez, and her husband - twinkle-eyed Mexican-American, in his early forties - Eduardo. They had a vineyard in California. Much of their business comes from tourists who arrive hourly. They are genuinely gullible, and it is quite easy to tell them any sophisticated things about wine. Everything was very pleasant, but she wanted something else.</p>

<p>9...&#160;&#160;&#160;So, in time, and with Mrs Elm's assistance, Nora took lots of books from the shelves and there was almost any life she was living in the universe. She realised that she hadn't tried to end her life because  she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery. Eventually Nora began to lose any sense of who she was.</p>

<p>10.&#160;&#160;&#160;And at last she tried the life that was very close to her. The life where she became wife of Ash. Both of them were very successful people, had good work, house, daughter. But she felt she's living not own life.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;And at last - her own life. Choking, exhausted, dehydated, trembling, heavy, delirious, pain in her chest, even more pain in her head - it was life that she wanted.</p>
        <h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>It seems deficalt to live in others body. She can find her own happy.</p>

        <h3>Phrases:</h3>
<p>Well, that sounds up your street.<br>
Well, far be it from me to say<br>
quaint stone terraced houses on a gently curving road nestled an the edge of a village before fading into the stillness of the countryside.<br>
you couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole.(about city or person)<br>
'Want' - it means lack<br>
sometimes the only way to learn is to live<br>
the swim was well under way<br>
