        <h1>The old man and the sea</h1>
        <p>published in 1952</p>

        <h3>characters and places:</h3>
<p><span class="char">To Charlie Scribner and Max Perkins</span></p>
<p><span class="char">Santiago</span> - The old man. Was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer were on his cheeks and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords, but his eyes were the same color as the sea were cheerful and undefeated.</p>
<p><span class="char">Manolin</span> - boy, friend of Santiago</p>

        <h3>events:</h3>
<p>Santiago lived in small shack on the coast. Shack made of the tough budshields of the royl palm which are called guano and there was a bed in it, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal.<br> 
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Culf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. But his record was eighty-seven days without fish. The next day he decided to go very far from the coast.<br>
He went out early. It was still dark, the moon was behind the hills. He was out of the mouth of the harbour, passed 'Great well' where was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms. Here there were concentrations of shrimps and bait fish and schools of squid in the deepest holes. He could hear the sound of flying fish. He was very fond of them. He was sorry for the birds, especially  delicate dark terns and sea swallows and he thought they have harder life than we do. He always thought of the sea as 'la mar' as people call her in Spanish when they love her as a woman. She is kind and very beautiful, but she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly.<br>
Man-of_war bird with his long black wings helps him to see where the fish is. He think it could be a big school of dolphin. They are moving too fast, but may be he can pick up a stray. He happy to see much of plankton because it meant fish. The strange light of sun in the water meant good weather and so did the shape of clouds.<br>
'Agua  mala' - purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder with its long deadly filaments was couse of his welts and sores on his hands when he working a fish. Poisonings came quickly and struck like a whiplash.<br>
This time he got luck to hook a huge fish. She dragged him around during two days. And day to add, he was getting home and had a fights with the sharks. He returned home exhausted with just a skeleton of fish.

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>What a great man this Santiago. Strong physically and spiritualy. He lives with nature. God bless him.
</p>
        
        <h3>Phrases:</h3>
<p>..He always thought of the sea as 'la mar' (as feminine, not 'el mar' as masculine) as people call her in Spanish when they love her as a woman. She is kind and very beautiful, but she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly.<br>
