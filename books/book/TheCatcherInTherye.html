<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Holdon is  writing his diary. He is at Pencey Prep, a rather prestigious school, but Holden doesn't see it that way. It's going to be Christmas vacation. He wasn't supposed to come back after on account of he was flunking four subjects and not applying himself and all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;It is Saturday, December, very cold. He'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. The meeting did not take place due to the team's late arrival. Everyone blamed Holden for this and ostracized him the whole the way back.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Holden is freezing his ass off on the Thomsen Hill, watching on the field - football between Saxon Hall and Pencey. The week before some crooks had stolen his camel's-hair coat and fur-lined gloves - The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has. Realy, he's trying to feel some kind of a good-by.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;He visits the Spencers and he have to listen his notations. Everyone is trying to convince him to come to his senses.
