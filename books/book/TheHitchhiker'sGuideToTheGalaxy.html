  <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h1>
    1979 year (novel) 143 pages.
  <h3>characters and places:</h3>
  <p><span class="char">Arthur Dent</span>, about thirty, dark haired. Worked in local radio.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Mr.L.Prosser</span> was, as they say, only human.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Ford Prefect</span> was not from Guildford as he usually claimed, but from a small.
  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</p>
  <p><span class="char">"Horse and Groom" </span>- bar.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Damogran</span> - planet five hundred thousand light years from the Sol.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="char">Zaphod Beeblebrox</span> - President of the Imperial Galactic Government. He is two
    hundred years old. Roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head
    and third arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="char">Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz</span> was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His
    highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green
    rubbery skin was thick and waterproof. As a fairly typical Vogon - thoroughly
    vile.
  </p>
  <p><span class="char">Dentrassis</span> - are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Starship Heart of Cold.</span></p>
  <p><span class="char">Trillian</span> - girl, that leave The Earth with Zaphod.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Marvin</span> - robot.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="char">Magrathea</span> - the most improbabale planet that ever existed. It's located
    in Horsehead Nebula, have two suns - Soulianis and Rahm.
  </p>
  <p><span class="char">Slartibartfast</span> - tallish, elderly resident of the Magrathea.</p>
  <p><span class="char">Deep Thought</span> - computer.</p>

  <h3>events:</h3>
  <p>
  Arthur is trying to protect his house, then gets drunk with Ford Prefect and
  gets on a spaceship of the Vogon Constructor Fleet. The Earth was demolished.
  </p>
  <p>
  Then they were thrown out of the ship into outer space and were picked up
  by Starship Heart of Gold. Zaphod Beeblebrox, who stole that ship, turned out
  a good freind of Ford and Trillian an acquaintance of Arthur. All of that
  seems happend cos improbability drive supposedly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then they landed on the Magrathea. Zaphod, Trillian and Ford got in a trap.
    Arthur flew away with Slartibartfast inside the planet. Arthur learns a lot of
    interesting things about the Earth. All company is getting together and have to
    run. Now they can do evrything they want. (to be continued)
  </p>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    Satirical work. The most amasing point that Arthur and Trillian have no  any 
    ties with the Earth. The Deep Thought (great comp) coudn't give the answer
    what for all of this.
