  <h3>characters and places:</h3>
  <p>
  Arthur Dent<br>
  Mr.L.Prosser was, as they say, only human.<br>
  Ford Prefect was not from Guildford as he usually claimed, but from a small<br>
  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.<br>
  "Horse and Groom" - bar.<br>
  Damogran - planet five hundred thousand light years from the Sol.<br>
  Zaphod Beeblebrox - President of the Imperial Galactic Government. He is two<br>
  hundred years old. Roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head<br>
  and third arm.<br>
  Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons.His<br>
  highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green<br>
  rubbery skin was thick and waterproof. As a fairly typical Vogon - thoroughly<br>
  vile.<br>
  Dentrassis - are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch.<br>
  Starship Heart of Cold<br>
  </p>
  <h3>events:</h3>
  <p>
  Arthur is trying to protect his house, then gets drunk with Ford Prefect and<br>
  gets on a spaceship of the Vogon Constructor Fleet. The Earth was demolished.
  </p>
  <p>
  Then they were thrown out of the ship into outer space and were picked up<br>
  by Starship Heart of Gold.
