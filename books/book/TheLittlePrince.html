        <h3>events:</h3>
<p>When author was six years old he was impressed by picture of boa constrictor eats its prey. And made picture  by yourself as boa constrictor digestin an elephant.</p>
<p>Years later he had an acident on a plane in the Desert of Sahara as a pilot. The next morning he met a boy who was called by him as Little Prince. Boy asked him to draw a sheep and was satisfied by a picture of a box in which he said was a sheep.</p>
<p>Little prince flew, presumably, from asteroid B-612. The greate catastrophe that could happened to little asteroid is baobabs.</p>
<p>On the fifth day they were arguing about thorns of flowers. "Matters of consequence" terribly outraged Prince and he remebered a certain red-faced gentleman from one planet that just add up figures and nothing more. And that makes him swell up with pride. Actualy, Little prince was fall in love with the flower on his own planet. He could not endure her temperament and just escape from his home.</p>
<p>First planet which he's vizited was inhabited by a king. The old man sat upon a throne, clad in royal purple and ermine. He tried to made his orders reasonable but it was nobody who need it indeed. </p>
<p>Second planet is inhabited by conceited man. Someone should express their admire him.</p>
<p>Third planet is inhabited by tippler. He's just making up a reason to drink. </p>
<p>Fourth planet with a businessman. He is very busy by adding numbers. Little prince told that no one needed him. </p>
<p>Fifth planet is very strange. Just street lamp and lamplighter. Lamplighter switches the lamp on without any sense. Cause this is such  the order. It doesn't seem to Little Prince ridiculous as much as previous ones.
</p>
<p>Sixth planet, rather big, with old gentleman who called yourself geographer. He has voluminous book where he's writing out geografical features of diffrent planets from the words of explorers. But first with a pencil. And with ink after checking explorer's moral character and furnishing another proofs by him. It is him who advised Little Prince to visit The Earth.</p>
<p>After arriving on The Earth Little Prince found himself in the African desert. His first encounter was with the wise snake. The snake said he could feel lonely among men as much as in the desert and if he grow too homesick for his planet he could send him very faraway, to the earth from whence he came.<br>
Then was a flower of no account at all. He said that people have no roots. That's why wind blows them away and makes their lives very difficult.<br>
Then, he tried to talk with echo in mountains; after that he came upon a road and it leaded to a garden, all a-bloom with roses. Roses were just alike as his flower at home. He was very upset by that he hasn't possess too much in his life and his flower just abused him.<br>
And then he met the fox. That fox taught Little prince what it is 'tame' - to create precious - to establish ties. Essential things you should see by your heart and to be responsible for what you have tamed.<br>
After fox he met switchman. Switchman sent trains in different directions. Little prince was wondering that all people in a great hurry, don't know what they want and never satisfied what they have. And only children know what they are looking for.<br>
And then merchant. He sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. One can think evrything could be done by pills.<br>
And, at last, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who tried to repair his plane in the desert Sahara on the Earth. On the eighth day he was drinking the last drop of water supply and went with his new freind to look for well. He was very thirsty and a sudden think astonished him - the beautiful of desert is in hiding a secret - there is water in its depth and beautiful of Little prince is in his love.<br>
They found the well of theirs dream. And it was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of arms. It was good for heart.
