      <p>Published	in 1890; 82 pages.</p>
      <h3>characters and places:</h3>
<p><span class="char">Dorian Gray</span> - Certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair. Grandson of Lord Kelso. Mother of him - Lady Margaret. </p>
<p><span class="char">Lady Margaret Devereaux</span> - (mother of Dorian) was extraordinarily beautiful girl running away with a subaltern in a foot regiment. Lord Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute to insult and to kill that chap in a duel at Spa a few month after the marriage. He brought his daughter back with him. She never spoke to him  again and died within a year. </p>
<p><span class="char">Basil Hallward</span> - the artist. He and Henry went to Oxford. Has got studio not far from London.</p>
<p><span class="char">Lord Henry Wotton</span> - Lives on Curson Street. Brown beard, olive-coloured face with worn expression and low languid voice, patent-leather boots, tasselled ebony cane. Smoking innumerable cigarettes.</p>
<p><span class="char">Lady Henry</span> Victoria - curious woman, wife of Henry. She dresses always as if it had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest, usualy in love with somebody and her passion was never returned. And she has  a perfect mania for going to church.</p>
<p><span class="char">Lady Brandon</span> - Where Basil have met Dorian.</p>
<p><span class="char">Lady Agatha</span> - aunt of Henry. We could see at her lunch: Duchess of Harley - very stoutness, admirable good-nature and good temper; Sir  Thomas Burdon - a Radical member of Parlament; Mr. Erskine of Treadley - an old gentlman of considerable charm and culture, who was usualy silent; Mrs. Vandeleur - one of oldest friend of Lady Agatha, a perfect saint amongst women, but dradfully dowdy; Lord Faudel - a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity; </p>
<p><span class="char">Lord George Fermor</span> - a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor. Uncle of Lord Henry. Has bushy white eyebrows. His father had been ambassador at Madrid, but had retired from the Diplomatic Service in a capricious. He considered that he was fully entitled  by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches and his inordinate passion for pleasure to have offer from Embassy at Paris. The son resigned along with him. And was doing paticulary nothing now. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.</p>
<p><span class="char">Sibyl Vane</span> - the actress. First love of Dorian. Girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips  that were like the petals of a rose. Lives with mother and brother on Euston Road. Her brother James(Jim) - rough brown hair, thickset of figure and his hand and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in mvovement. A year younger than Sibyl. </p>
      <h3>events:</h3>
<p>Studio of Basil Hallward not far from London. He almost finished the portrait of Dorian Gray. Here Basil introduces Lord Henry Wotton with Dorian. Dorian, when saw picture of himself said he would give his soul for he remain young and it grow old.</p>
<p>Next day Henry visited his uncle Lord Fermor to know about Dorian's parentage and have diner at Lady Agatha where he offered how remain young - to commit the great errors that one committed in early days.</p>

<p>First adventure of Dorian - Sibyl Vane. An actress of a little theater. She call him Prince Charming. Dorian was shure he loves her, but was not interested her as a person just as various images on a stage. The love quickly gave way to contempt. Nice girl put entire live into her fantasies committed suicide. In that day Dorian noticed that the picture of himself began change. Expression looked diffrent. There was a touch of cruelty in the mouth.</p>

<p>Subsequent years, Dorian plunges into a completely dissolute life, trying to experience all kinds of sins. Rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs. His view in the portrait is becoming more and more evil and ageing, but this did not affect his appearance in any way. Besides that, Dorian didn't forget to have relations to society. From time to time rich and luxurious parties have been made with a great taste and he was an idol of youth in everything.</p>

<p>Misticism moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of Darwinistic movement in Germany; he study perfumes and secrets of their manufacture; at another time he devoted himself entirely to music. Gypsies, Tunisians, negroes, Indians were on his concerts. He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that he could found; on one occasion he took up the study of jewels. This taste enthralled him for years, and may be never left him; then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries.

      <p></p>
      <h3>Phrases:</h3>
... evry portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.(Basil)<br> 
...Lord Fermor had set himself to the serious study of the grate aristocratic art of doing absolutely  nothing.<br>
...Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentlman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentlman, what ever he knows is bad for him. (Lord Fermor)<br>
