        <h3>events:</h3>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Richmond - the city where the man live, that author calls  The Time Treveller. He has guests on evry Thursday. This time the Time Traveller is expounding a recondite matter to his friends - about geometry of Four Dimensions. And to prove his words he's sending a litlle model into future. No one really believe him cause (as the auther says) he is too clever.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; Next Thursday he came to dinner when all guests were at the table already. He was in amazing plight - dirty, haggard, without shoes and limped. According to him, he stayed in the laboratory for about three hours and lived for eight days.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; Here is the story he told:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; He got on his car and departure in a travel through time. He's stopped in 802701 AD(anno domini(lat) нашего бога, нашей эры). First he saw was a great monument of white marble like winged sphinx on bronze pedestal with thick verdigris. Than, some creatures about four feet high in rich soft robes. The hail shower has just ended. It was very warm and full of all kinds of greenery around. Creatures led him in a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. The building had  a huge entry and colossal dimensions. Evrything seemed badly broken and weather-worn. The windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone a foot high with heaps of fruits. Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; This night he realise he lost his machine and pushed his exploration here and there. So far, all the world displayed exuberant richness. Abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style, clustering thickets of evergreens, blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. There were certain circular wells rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. They, obviously, had connection with tall towers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; He began to realize that the earth was inhabited by two kinds of creatures. Those are Eloi, who live on Earth and  Morlocks - underground. One day he went down to the Morlocks' mine. He had to clamber down a shaft of about two hundred yards by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides. Then slender loophole in the wall that was aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnnel. Then he enter to a vast arched cavern. He could see just in the burning of a match. It was very stuffy and opressive. There were big machines and the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with fresh meat. The Morlocks tried to haul him. He could scarcely got out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; Then he took Weena and went to find more safe place. The first night they spent in the open air. Next day they reached Palace of Green Porcelain. It turned out to be a long-abandoned museum. He broke the lever sticking out of the machine to use it as a club and found matches and camphor. They emerged from the place only in the evening. He decided to go through the forest in the dark. There he accidentally arranged big fire and lost his Weena.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; Next day he returned to White Sphinx. The Morlocks opened the gate to lure the traveler. He entered the apartment and managed to use his machine. But accidentally turned the lever into the future and thus, he visited the Eathe in 30 million years. That was cold dying planet with thin air and red sun about tenth of sky size.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; He returned home, told the story and next day went off to time travel again. After that no one see him.</p>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Judging by the description of how the travel scientist acted - he is a rare jerk. Possibly, it was normal in England in the nineteenth century or may be it was lack of tobaco and alcohol in travelling. But he has incredible tenacity to reach his target.</p>

        <h3>Phrases:</h3>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;The true civilizing process that makes life more secure - had gone steadily on to a climax.</p>
